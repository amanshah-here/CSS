      The Avengers are a team of superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel
      Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, based on the eponymous team from
      Marvel Comics created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1963. Founded by
      S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury, the team is a United States–based
      organization composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals,
      described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are committed to the world's
      protection from a variety of threats.

    <h3>The Avengers Initiative</h3>
    <p>
      In 1995, S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury creates the Avengers Initiative,
      envisioning it as a group of heroes working to respond to planetary
      threats, following the appearance of Carol Danvers and naming it after her
      U.S. Air Force callsign, "Avenger".[1][2] Years later, Fury assesses
      various individuals for it, including Tony Stark[3] and Steve Rogers.[4]
      Stark's membership is declined after a negative report by S.H.I.E.L.D.
      agent Natasha Romanoff.[5] The World Security Council wanted Emil Blonsky
      to join, but rejected it after Stark deters Thaddeus Ross from the idea,
      hiring Bruce Banner instead.[6]

    <h3>The first assembly</h3>
    <p>
      n 2012, the Asgardian Loki teleports to the Joint Dark Energy Mission
      Facility on Earth, where he steals the Tesseract and brainwashes Clint
      Barton and Dr. Erik Selvig using his scepter. Subsequently, Fury recruits
      Stark and Banner to locate the Tesseract. Rogers, Romanoff, and Stark
      apprehend Loki, but are disrupted by Thor's arrival. This leads to
      confrontations between the group, exacerbated by the revelation that
      S.H.I.E.L.D. is using the Tesseract to create weapons of mass destruction.
      Barton attacks the Helicarrier, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk
      and cause damage. After Loki kills S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson, the
      team unites to avenge him, with Romanoff freeing Barton from the scepter's
      control. Rogers then recruits Barton to the team as a new member. The
      Avengers confront Loki, who opens a wormhole using the Tesseract and
      begins an invasion with his Chitauri army, starting a battle.[8] Stark
      introduces the team to Loki by referring to them as "Earth's Mightiest
      Heroes".[9] Eventually, the World Security Council launches a nuclear
      missile towards Manhattan, but Stark intercepts and flies it through the
      wormhole, destroying the Chitauri mother ship and stopping the invasion.
      Romanoff closes the portal with the scepter and the team apprehends Loki,
      who is taken back to Asgard.[8]
